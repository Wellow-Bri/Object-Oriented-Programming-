# Python Assignment 🐍

This repository contains two activities for my Python assignment.

---

## 📌 Activity 1: Design Your Own Class
- Created a class `CeraVeProduct` with attributes (name, product_type, price).  
- Added methods to show product details and apply discounts.  
- Used constructors to initialize objects with unique values.  
- Implemented **inheritance** with a `Moisturizer` subclass that adds extra attributes like SPF and skin type.

## 📌 Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge
- Created a base class `Vehicle` with a method `move()`.  
- Subclasses (`Car`, `Plane`, `Boat`) each override the `move()` method to demonstrate **polymorphism**.
